# Project : AI Face Mask Detector
 COMP 6721- Applied Artificial Intelligence

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8

## Setting Up a Project
1. Run the Face_Mask_Detector_Train.py file with the correct data set file path
2. Please create a folder named 'Results' in the folder from which you are running the code
3. After executing the Face_Mask_Detector_Train.py, a file will be generated with trained model information that can be used for predicting the images in prediction folder along with Loss-graph and Confusion matrix and a classification report csv file in the results folder.
4. Create a folder named 'Prediction' with in the results folder
5.After successful execution of step 3,4 run Face_Mask_Prediction.py to predict all the images that are present in given prediction folder path.
6. For all the images in prediction folder it will predict the image into either one of the categories from Cloth_Mask, No_Mask, Surgical_Mask,N95_Mask, Mask_Worn_incorrectly.
