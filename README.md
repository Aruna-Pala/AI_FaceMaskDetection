# Project : AI Face Mask Detector
 COMP 6721- Applied Artificial Intelligence

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7.9

## Setting Up a Project
1. Run the cnn-train-model.py file with giving the accurate paths for all the three folders i.e., train, test, pred in cnn-train-model.py
2. After executing the cnn-train-model.py, a file will be generated with trained model information that is used for predicting the images in pred folder along with Line-graph and Confusion matrix.
3.After successful execution of step 2, run cnn-prediction.py to predict all the images that are present in given pred folder path.
4. For all the images in pred folder it will predict the image into either one of the categories from Cloth_Mask, No_Mask, Surgical_Mask,N95_Mask, Mask_Worn_incorrectly.
